# Fictional Health Club

I create a website about the old people`s health club.
This website contain information about shedule of events which
can happen nearest time or for a year, about partners and
photos main members of community.  

## Technologies
I use grid as website layout and try to create adaptive size
using grid properties. I also use flexbox 
where I think it is best suited.
I try to use media quaries as rarely as I can.
I also try to use responsive width and height and try to 
systematize css properties.

## Website

I use github pages for hosting, so you can find my website [here](https://igorzvezdilin.github.io/health-club-grid-flexbox/).
